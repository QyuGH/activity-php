                Forest Bean Co. Coffee began as a small passion project in January 2025, born from a simple belief: great
                coffee should feel like a warm embrace from nature itself. What started as a weekend booth at a local
                farmer’s market slowly grew into a cozy neighborhood café known for its earthy atmosphere and
                hand-crafted brews. Inspired by the calm of misty forest mornings, our founders set out to create a
                space where people could slow down, reconnect, and enjoy coffee the way it was meant to be fresh,
                intentional, and full of character. Every corner of Forest Bean reflects this vision, from our rustic
                interiors to our sustainably sourced beans roasted in small batches.

                Today, Forest Bean Co. offers a wide range of crafted beverages, from bold signature brews and
                smooth cold coffees to refreshing non-coffee alternatives and delightful desserts. Over the years, we’ve
                expanded our menu with locally inspired flavors and artisanal blends that showcase the richness of our
                region’s coffee farms. Whether you're dropping by for a quiet morning cup or meeting friends for an
                afternoon treat, our goal is to serve drinks that bring comfort, warmth, and a touch of nature’s charm.
                Forest Bean continues to grow, but one thing remains unchanged—our dedication to crafting honest,
                flavorful coffee and creating a welcoming community space for all.
